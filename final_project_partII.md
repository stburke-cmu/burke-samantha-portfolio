# Project Outline
1. What is the current public opinion on nuclear energy?
- A lot of people oppose it
- They actually prefer solar and wind power
2. Why should people change their mind?
- Clean
-- emissions avoided 
-- it actually generates less emissions over the total life cycle
- Capacity (putting it into perspective)
-- 100 million LED lightbulbs 
-- 312.5 million solar panels
-- 342 utility grade wind turbines (the big ones)
- Footprint (literal square miles)
-- Nuclear power plant = 1 mile radius
-- Solar panels to generate that amount of power = 
-- Wind turbines to generate that power = 
- Jobs, money, etc facts
4. Why is it so important?
-- energy consumption is increasing, we need something clean that can keep up
5. Call to action: Become an advocate for nuclear energy.
