# Project Part II
## Outline Draft 1
  1. Intro:  What does the public think about energy production?
      * A lot of people oppose it. 
      * They prefer solar and wind.
  1. Data & Analysis: Maybe we should reconsider?
      * Energy consumption is only increasing and we need something that can keep up
      * Nuclear energy produces zero carbon emissions
      * It doesn't need sun or wind to operate. It can operate at nearly full capacity year round.
      * It generates more power than most renewable sources combined
  1. Call to Action
      * Become an advocate for nuclear energy. 
      * Join Nuclear Matters to help raise awareness

## Audience/User stories
  1. My target audience is anyone that's concerned about the environment. Frankly, we all probably should be.
  1. User stories:
      *   "I want to learn how to reduce my carbon footprint so that I can help preserve the earth."
      *   "I know climate change is real and I want to do my part, but I need to educate myself."

## Research Process
I started my process by creating a wireframe in Balsamiq (see below). It was very preliminary, but it helped me get the layout sorted out. I showed this to the people I interviewed. They said it was a good start, but I could improve the way it flows. At first I had the 'Nuclear Energy, it's not what you think" first, but after discussing it with them, I moved it to after the initial introduction. If the audience already has an opinion about Nuclear Energy, they may be less likely to look at the information with an open mind. The feedback helped me create a stronger introduction and rethink some of my graphics. Next, I started putting my work into Shorthand. I included some screenshots below. I walked each person through the Shorthand draft. Each person seemed to get hung up on the "put this into perspective" portion. I definitely need to redesign that portion for my final submission. Based on the feedback I got after showing this version, I also decided to further revise my story line. The introduction was still kind of awkward. My revision outline is below. I did incorporated some of the revisions in my screenshots at the bottom of this page. Overall, the feedback I received from the interviews helped me build a stronger introduction, eliminate some of the "fluff" and focus on the important information.

## Draft Revisions
   1. Intro:  We know climate change exists but what do we do about it?
      * Energy use is increasing
      * How do we reduce our carbon footprint while sustaining our energy use?
   1. Data & Analysis: Nuclear Energy: It's not what you think
      * Nuclear energy produces zero carbon emissions
      * It's actually very safe.
      * It generates more power than most renewable sources combined
      * It doesn't need sun or wind to operate. It can operate at nearly full capacity year round
      * The earth only has so much real-estate for solar panels and wind turbines. We need nuclear energy too.
  1. Call to Action
      * Become an advocate for nuclear energy. 
      * Join Nuclear Matters to help raise awareness

## To Do
  1. Sources
  l. Embed graphics 
      * Right now, they are just screenshots.
  1. Polish visualizations
      *  Fonts, color, titles, captions
      *  Include more icons and statistics
  1. Change the "to put it into perspective" graphic. 
      * It looks clunky
