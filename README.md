CMU Fall 2020 - Telling Stories with Data 
<br>
# About Me
My name is Samantha Burke (she/her/hers). I am a part-time graduate student in the Heinz College pursuing a Masters of Science in Information Technology on the Business Intelligence and Data Analytics track. I moved from Colorado to the Pittsburgh area in January 2020. I am currently a full time Data Engineer at Tinuiti, a digital marketing agency. I integrate data from various marketing platforms (Google Ads, Bing, Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, Pinterest, etc) and build datasets for analysts to use for client reporting. I also build adhoc reports to summarize data across digital marketing channels to track high level performance. 
Fun fact about me - I have a Shiba Inu and he's the goodest of boys. He loves the snow and going hiking. He's been to the top of more 14,000ft+ mountains than most people!

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn new strategies for visualizing data that I can utilize in my current role. I want readers to understand the point I'm trying to make without putting too much thought into it. I want to practice designing more creative and visually appealing graphics. The reports I've built in the past definitely need some spice!
