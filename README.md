<br>
# About Me
My name is Samantha Burke (she/her/hers). I am a part-time graduate student in the Heinz College pursuing a Masters of Science in Information Technology on the Business Intelligence and Data Analytics track. I moved from Colorado to the Pittsburgh area in January 2020. I am currently a full time Data Engineer at Tinuiti, a digital marketing agency. I primarily integrate data from various marketing platforms and build datasets for analysts to use for client reporting. 
I also build adhoc reports to summarize data across digital marketing channels for internal teams to track high level performance.
