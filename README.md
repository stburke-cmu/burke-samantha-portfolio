CMU Fall 2020 - Telling Stories with Data 
<br>
# About Me
My name is Samantha Burke (she/her/hers). I am a part-time graduate student in the Heinz College pursuing a Masters of Science in Information Technology on the Business Intelligence and Data Analytics track. I moved from Colorado to the Pittsburgh area in January 2020. I am currently a full time Data Engineer at Tinuiti, a digital marketing agency. I integrate data from various marketing platforms (Google Ads, Bing, Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, Pinterest, etc) and build datasets for analysts to use for client reporting. I also build adhoc reports to summarize data across digital marketing channels to track high level performance. 
Fun fact about me - I have a Shiba Inu and he's the goodest of boys. He loves the snow and going hiking. He's been to the top of more 14,000ft+ mountains than most people!

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn new strategies for visualizing data that I can utilize in my current role. I want readers to understand the point I'm trying to make without putting too much thought into it. I want to practice designing more creative and visually appealing graphics. The reports I've built in the past definitely need some spice!

I chose to vizualize the data using a treemap because it's immediately apparent which countries have a larger or smaller debt ratio in comparison to the others. The purpose of the graphic is to show how the USA's debt ratio compares to other countries for a given year. We emphasize the USA by coloring it differently than the other countries. All of the other countries are colored the same to because they are not the focus. Graphic 1 does not use coloring to emphasize specific countries. Instead of looking at the data by year, like Graphic 1, this graphic highlights the debt ratio by country for a single year. Users can filter between years to see how countries compare to each other. The specific GDP-to-debt ratio values aren't as important in this scenario because we're trying to highlight how they compare generally.
