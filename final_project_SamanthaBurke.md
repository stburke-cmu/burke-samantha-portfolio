# Energy Around The World
I plan to illustrate the current trends in energy production and consumption. 
Nuclear energy has a negative connotation, especially after Cherynobyl. What a lot of people don't know is that Nuclear Power is zero-emission and is key to meeting clean air objectives.

## Outline
 1. Intro:  What does the public think about energy production?
    * Which sources do they support? 
    * Why does it matter?
 1. Data & Analysis
    * How do each of those sources perform?
      * Emission
      * Capacity
      * Cost
    * What about Nuclear Energy? It's not what you think.
      * Small land footprint
      * Minimal waste
      * Zero-emission
  1. Call to Action
      * Raise awareness 
      * Education is Key - where are we headed? Consider Nuclear Energy

# Initial Sketches
* Bar graph of public opinion on energy sources
* Cost by source
* Production capacity by source
* Overall energy consumption over time
* Heat map by country
* Heat map by state

## Data
* [Nuclear Energy World Capacity](https://www.nei.org/resources/statistics/world-nuclear-generation-and-capacity)

* [Nuclear Generating Statistics](https://www.nei.org/resources/statistics/us-nuclear-generating-statistics)

* [Nuclear Energy Costs](https://www.nei.org/resources/reports-briefs/nuclear-costs-in-contexthttps://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8mc7h6pfyb/1#__sid=js0)

* [Energy by Source](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/)

* [Energy Consumption by Region](https://ourworldindata.org/energy)

* [Nuclear Energy - Sustainable](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/3-reasons-why-nuclear-clean-and-sustainable)

* [Public Opinion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion_on_nuclear_issues)

The data sources above are recent information relating to energy production, consumption, and cost around the world. 
I plan to use these datasets to create graphics about energy around the world. 

## Method
I plan to use Shorthand and Tableau.
