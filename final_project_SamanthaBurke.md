# The Future of Clean Energy
Nuclear energy has a negative connotation, especially after Cherynobyl. What a lot of people don't realize is that Nuclear Power is a zero-emission energy source and a key contributor to clean air objectives.

## Outline
 1. Intro:  What does the public think about energy production?
    * Which sources do they support? 
    * Why does it matter?
 1. Data & Analysis
    * How do each of those sources perform?
      * Emission
      * Capacity
      * Cost
    * What about Nuclear Energy? It's not what you think.
      * Small land footprint
      * Minimal waste
      * Zero-emission
  1. Call to Action
      * Raise awareness about Nuclear energy
      * Education is Key

# Initial Sketches
These are the type of graphics I plan to visualize:
* Bar graph of public opinion on energy sources
* Death rates by source
* Cost by source
* Production capacity by source
* Overall energy consumption over time
* Heat map of energy consumption by country
* Heat map of nuclear energy capacity by state

<i>Interesting Call Outs</i>
1. NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS PRODUCED 809 BILLION KILOWATT HOURS OF ELECTRICITY IN 2019
2. NUCLEAR POWER PROVIDES 55% OF AMERICAâ€™S CLEAN ENERGY
4. NUCLEAR HELPS POWER 29 U.S. STATES

The data sources above are recent information relating to energy production, consumption, and cost around the world. The sites above contain data that I plan to export for graphics and statistics that I plan to use for specific call outs and interesting facts.

## Method
I plan to use Shorthand and Tableau to illustrate data about energy consumption and production.
I want to make my project interactive and engaging. The color scheme will likely be green and gray. The color green goes hand in hand with clean energy. I want to keep text to a minimum, but I plan to include some small text blurbs and call outs. My goal is to increase people's awareness about Nuclear power.
