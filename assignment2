The purpose of the graphic is to show how the USA's debt ratio compares to other countries for a given year. I chose to vizualize the data using a treemap because it's immediately apparent which countries have a larger or smaller debt ratio in comparison to the others. We emphasize the USA by coloring it differently than the other countries. All of the other countries are colored the same to because they are not the focus. Graphic 1 does not use coloring to emphasize specific countries. By changing the coloring to emphasize the US, I modified the intended audience. The audience for this graphic is more specific compared to the other graphic. Also, instead of looking at the data by year, like Graphic 1, this graphic highlights the debt ratio by country for a single year. Users can filter between years to see how countries compare to each other. The specific GDP-to-debt ratio values aren't as important in this scenario because we're trying to highlight how they compare generally.
